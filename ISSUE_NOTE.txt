Regarding sum of angles changes to handle 3 parallel axis case:

1) there are two very similar codes which are dupes and should be unified:
    a)  find_xy in ikbtbasics.py
    b)  find_xy in sum_transform.py

2) there are two methods that use find_xy to substitue sum-of-angles.  One is in sum_transform.py
    and another is a method member of the Robot class (!)   the later is used in updateL. 

We need to eliminate these redundancies so that we can fix the 3-parallel axis case.   Strategy:

1) elmininate duplcated codes
2) find a new method other than the set lookup table (or maybe a lookup table with a two list input):

   {[th1,th2] : [ th12, th123],\\
    [th2,th3] : [th23, th 123, th234] }  etc.
